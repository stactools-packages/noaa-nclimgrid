# Maybe we should not worry about the problem of the nc files being updated in
# place. Let the user worry about that. They can use either COG existence and/or
# Item existence control whether a new Item should be created.
#   - This will require a public function to create COGs for a single date and a
#     public function to create a single Item from an nc_href and a list of cog
#     hrefs.
# If it is super simple to add to create Items, we can turn this on with a flag
